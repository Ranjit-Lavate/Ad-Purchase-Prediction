# KNN Customer Ad Purchase Prediction

## 🧠 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict whether a user will purchase an ad or not based on their **Age** and **Estimated Salary** using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification algorithm.

## 📊 Dataset
- **File:** `Social_Network_Ads.csv`
- **Features:**
  - User ID
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Estimated Salary
  - Purchased (Target)

## 🧩 Model Used
- Algorithm: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Steps:
  1. Data Preprocessing
  2. Splitting into Train/Test sets
  3. Feature Scaling
  4. Model Training using KNN
  5. Prediction and Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy)

## 🧾 Results
The KNN model successfully predicts whether a customer will purchase the ad based on given features.
